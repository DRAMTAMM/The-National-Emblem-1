<h2> The National Symbol </h2>
<p> The national emblem is a symbol of representation of a country which is unique in its design and structure. Any other country cannot use the national emblem of one country. Documents representing national interests are stamped or sealed by the national emblem. Many countries choose to have a national emblem despite having a national flag. The national emblem gives an identity to a country. The national emblems could be anything ranging from symbols of an animal to birds. The national animal, the national bird or the national flower can be adapted as a national emblem by a country.

The national emblem of India was adopted in 1950 after the constitution of India came into force. The national emblem of India is an adaption of the Lion Capital of the Asoka at Sarnath. The structure of lion capital was a creation of Asoka in the third century BC. Sarnath is a place located in Uttar Pradesh, near Varanasi.

Among the four lions, three are visible when seen upfront. The fourth lion is invisible. The base on which the lion capital stands consists of a central Dharma Chakra with a bull on the right and galloping horse in the left. The dharma chakras that are located on the left and right side of the abacus can be slightly seen when looked upfront.

The lions of the National emblem of India signify power, courage, confidence and pride each. The other animals that we can see is a horse and bull but, an elephant and lion remain invisible. Al these animals have something to signify and represent. The horse is implied as to the horse of Buddha, which, he rode while exiting the citadel. The bull signifies Taurus, the zodiac sign of Buddha. The elephant denotes Buddha’s birth (as Buddha’s mother dreamt of a white elephant entering her womb during his birth). The lion denotes enlightenment. The national emblem was created by Asoka, who was a disciple of Buddha. This is why the impact of Buddhist doctrine and principles can be found in the national emblem of India. Asoka was a great emperor who later became a Buddhist monk after the notorious battle of Kalinga.
